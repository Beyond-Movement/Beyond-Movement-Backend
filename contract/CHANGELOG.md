# API contract changelog

Every change to a request or response shape is a breaking change for the Flutter app.
Record it here, regenerate `openapi.yaml`, and tell the mobile developer.

To regenerate: run the API, fetch `GET /openapi/v1.json`, and convert it to YAML.

## Phase 1.1 — Contract hardening, Google sign-in, change password

**Breaking.** Read this before regenerating the client.

### Breaking changes

| Change | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Current-user path | `GET /api/v1/me` | **`GET /api/v1/auth/me`** (matches architecture §14.1) |
| Logout auth | anonymous | **requires a bearer token** as well as the refresh token in the body (architecture §14.1 marks logout `B`) |
| `UserSummary.role` | free string | **`UserRole` enum** — `Admin` \| `Athlete` |
| `UserSummary` | no status | **`status` added** — `UserStatus`: `Active` \| `Paused` \| `Deleted` |
| Error body | framework `ProblemDetails` | **`ApiProblemDetails`** with `errorCode` and `correlationId` declared |
| Numeric fields | `type: [integer, string]` | **`type: integer`** — the union was a generator artefact; the API only ever wrote numbers |
| Reset link | `https://app.beyondmovement.com/...` | **`beyondmovement://reset-password?token=…`** |

### Added

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/google` | anonymous | Google ID-token sign-in |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/change-password` | **bearer** | Change password while signed in |

New response fields:

- `AuthResponse.refreshExpiresInSeconds` — refresh-token lifetime (30 days), alongside the
  existing 15-minute `expiresInSeconds` for the access token.
- `CurrentUserResponse` — the now-documented `200` from `/auth/me`, carrying `id`, `role`,
  `status`, `fullName`, `email`, `coachId`, `profileCompleted` and `minimumSupportedAppVersion`.
- `ApiProblemDetails.retryAfterSeconds` — present on `ACCOUNT_LOCKED`, mirrored in the
  `Retry-After` header, so the app can show a real countdown.
- `ApiProblemDetails.errors` — per-field validation messages, present on `VALIDATION_FAILED`.

### Error codes

Declared as an enum on `ApiProblemDetails.errorCode`, so the generated client gets a checkable
set. Switch on this — never on `title`, which is human-readable text that may change.

| `errorCode` | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | 400 | Request shape rejected; see `errors` for per-field detail |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | 401 | Wrong password **or** unknown address — deliberately indistinguishable |
| `ACCOUNT_LOCKED` | 423 | Five failed attempts; see `retryAfterSeconds` |
| `ACCOUNT_PAUSED` | 403 | Paused account. Can arrive on *any* authenticated request |
| `INVALID_TOKEN` | 401 | The access token no longer maps to a live user |
| `INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN` | 401 | Expired, revoked, or replayed. Sign the user out |
| `INVALID_RESET_TOKEN` | 400 | Reset link expired or already used |
| `INVALID_GOOGLE_TOKEN` | 401 | Google ID token failed verification, or its email is unverified |
| `INVITATION_REQUIRED` | 403 | Google sign-in with no matching account. **Not** a registration path |
| `PASSWORD_NOT_SET` | 400 | Google-only account has no password to change |

### Behaviour the client must handle

- **Refresh rotation is single-use.** Each refresh returns a *new* refresh token; store it and
  discard the old one. Replaying a spent token revokes the entire family, so a client that
  retries with a stale token logs the user out for real.
- **`ACCOUNT_PAUSED` can appear mid-session.** An access token stays cryptographically valid for
  its full 15 minutes after an admin pauses the account, so the server re-checks status on every
  authenticated request. Now explicitly documented as a `403` on login, refresh and `/auth/me`.
- **`profileCompleted: false` means route to Complete Profile, not Home.** An athlete who has
  created an account but not finished the profile step comes back this way.
- **Google sign-in never registers.** Unknown Google account with no matching user →
  `403 INVITATION_REQUIRED` (BR-01). If a password account exists with the same *verified*
  Google email, the Google identity is linked to it and tokens are returned.
- **Change-password revokes every refresh token,** including the calling device's. The app must
  sign in again afterwards.
- **`/auth/forgot-password` always returns 200**, whether or not the address exists. Never show
  "no account found".
- **Password rule:** minimum 8 characters, rejected if on a common-password list. No composition
  rules (architecture §7.2).

### Password reset deep link

The email contains:

```
beyondmovement://reset-password?token=<url-encoded token>
```

The token is **URL-encoded** in the link — decode it before posting to `/auth/reset-password`.
It is **single-use** and expires after **one hour**. A used, unknown, or expired token returns
`400 INVALID_RESET_TOKEN`. On success every refresh token for that user is revoked.

Configured server-side via `App:PasswordResetUrlTemplate`, so switching to an HTTPS App Link
later is a configuration change, not a contract change.

### Not yet in the contract

Invitations (`POST /invitations`, `GET /invitations/validate`), `POST /auth/register`, and
athlete profile completion arrive next. There is no registration endpoint by design (BR-01) —
accounts are created by invitation only, and Google sign-in does not bypass that.

## Phase 1 — Authentication & Access

**Added — the first published endpoints.**

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/login` | anonymous | Email + password to an access token and a refresh token |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/refresh` | anonymous | Rotate a refresh token for a new pair |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | anonymous | Revoke the presented refresh token |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/forgot-password` | anonymous | Request a reset link |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/reset-password` | anonymous | Set a new password using a reset token |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/me` | bearer | The caller's identity, read from the token |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/ping` | anonymous | Liveness check |

**Security scheme:** `bearerAuth` (HTTP bearer, JWT). Send the `accessToken` from
`/auth/login` as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Access tokens last 15 minutes;
refresh tokens last 30 days.
